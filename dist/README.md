# GitHub AI Autobot Action v2 - Distribution

This directory contains the built and packaged JavaScript files that GitHub Actions executes.

## Important Note

**This repository is currently missing the built `dist/index.js` file that is required for the GitHub Action to function.**

To complete the setup:

1. Clone this repository locally
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Build the TypeScript: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
4. Package for distribution: `npm run package` or `yarn package`
5. Commit the generated `dist/` files back to the repository

## Why dist/ files are committed

GitHub Actions require the compiled JavaScript to be present in the repository since Actions run in isolated environments without build tools.

## Next Steps

1. **Set up local development environment**
2. **Run the build process to generate the required dist files**
3. **Create a v2.0.0 release once dist files are present**
4. **Update documentation with usage examples**

**Status: ðŸš§ In Development - Build process needed to complete setup**

Once the build process is complete, this will become a fully functional GitHub Action ready for production use.
